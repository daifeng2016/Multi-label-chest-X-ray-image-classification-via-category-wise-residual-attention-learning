## Overview
In this paper, we propose a category-wise residual attention learning (CRAL) framework. CRAL predicts the presence of multiple pathologies in a class-specific attentive view. The proposed framework consists of two modules: feature embedding module and attention learning module. The feature embedding module learns high-level features with a convolutional neural network (CNN) while the attention learning module focuses on exploring the assignment scheme of different categories.
